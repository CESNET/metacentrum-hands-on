# Introduction

## Aims
This tutorial takes the form of a brief hands-on course showing how to process and analyse sequencing data using the [MetaCentrum NGI](https://www.metacentrum.cz/en/index.html) (National Grid Infrastructure). Participants will be introduced to the basics of using MetaCentrum, including how to [log in to the front-end server](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/access/log-in), [manipulate data](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/data/large-data) properly, [start an interactive or batch job](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/computing/run-basic-job) and [install applications](https://docs.metacentrum.cz/en/docs/software/install-software) locally.

In the practical section of the course, we will analyse private (unpublished) [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/) (ONT) data from a pilot project investigating the distribution of methylation sites in the genome of [_Haemonchus contortus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemonchus_contortus), a gastrointestinal parasite of small ruminants. Unfortunately, processing raw ONT reads, basecalling and working with modified bases often require considerable hardware resources and time-consuming tuning to find the optimal parameters. To speed up this course, therefore, we will use a reduced input dataset and mostly default parameters during data processing.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **The aim of this course is not to create a perfect ONT data processing pipeline.**
> 
> Due to the time limitations of this course and its primary focus on using grid infrastructure as effectively as possible, we will carry out a few basic steps on a small sample of ONT genomic reads (in pod5 format). The aim is to identify modified (methylated) bases.

> [!NOTE]
> Throughout this tutorial, important points are supplemented with links to more detailed descriptions and explanations in the documentation.
